# Robot-Simulation
A Robot Simulator program with demonstration of the design process

The project is split into 3 componenets
- Iteration 1: In this iteration we build a simulator in which the user can control a robot moving around an arena. This design is built as a game where the goal is for the robot to capture all the bases.
- Iteration 2: In this iteration we build a simulator in which multiple autonomous robots can be observed. This follows Braitenberg vehicle behavior where the robots can exhibit different behavior such as "fear" and "exploratory". We also include a design document that describes the Observer design pattern used in this simulation.
- Iteration 3: In this iteration we attempt to add a GUI interface to our simulation from Iteration 2. The user cantrol the number of robots, food, and light that exists in the arena as well as adjust different aspects such as light sensor sensitivity.
