### Bug Report


## _major_ bugs:

>When robot and obstacle collide both objects get affected. If the obstacle collides with the robot it will perform the Arc Reverse as per requirements hower it will "push" the robot in the process.

>When two objects collide, due to overlap, they will have strange collision behvaior that does not follow the correct in game physics.

>Obstacles sometimes spawn on top of eachother. Bases also may spawn on top of eachother although less likely due to size. This is a major issue because the game will not be playable in such a way that the user can win/lose. 

>The Obstacles tend to clump at walls and corners. This can be especially dangerous if the players robot is in the same center because it may be trapped


## _minor_ bugs:

>Base can spawn on top of obstacle or vice versa. 

>Obstacle can spawn on top of robot causing one live to be lost.
